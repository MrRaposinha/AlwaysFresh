- Preventing style decay over time, preserving your hard-earned points.
- Removing penalties for repeated actions, offering freedom to experiment with your combat style.

This mod is perfect for players who want to experience the thrill of ULTRAKILL’s combat without worrying about style penalties or freshness decay.
